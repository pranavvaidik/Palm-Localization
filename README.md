# Palm-Localization

## Abstract
This projects aims to loacate the relative positions of the palms of a human in a video or image with respect to his/her own body. One of the applications to this includes detection of source of pain for the human based on the palm location.


## Requirements
The model was developed in tensorflow 2.0  in python 3 environment. The model is trained using transfer learning, with the pre-trained network from the OpenPose model (https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose). However, since this model was trained using a Caffee, a pretrained mobilenet network by Rachit at. el. (https://github.com/rachit2403/Open-Pose-Keras) was used for transfer learning.

You can install all the requirements from the requirements.txt file, updated in near future
